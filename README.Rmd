<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `sspm` is to implement a gam-based spatial surplus production model, aimed at modeling northern shrimp population in Canada but potentially to any stock in any location. The package is opinionated in its implementation of SPMs as it internally makes the choice to use penalized spatial gams with time lags  based on Pedersen et al. (2020). However, it also aims to provide options for the user to customize their model.

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of sspm from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->
<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("sspm") -->
<!-- ``` -->

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pedersen-fisheries-lab/sspm")
```

## Example

The following example shows the typical `sspm` workflow. The API is subject to changes as the package is still in development.

Let's first load the packages and the test data.

```{r}
library(sspm)
library(mgcv)
library(dplyr)

borealis <- sspm:::borealis_simulated
predator <- sspm:::predator_simulated %>%
  mutate(year = as.factor(year))
catch <- sspm:::catch_simulated

sfa_boundaries <- sspm:::sfa_boundaries
```

1. The first step of the `sspm` workflow is to create a `sspm_boundary` from an `sf` object, providing the `boundary_column` that delineates the boundary regions. The object can then be plotted with `spm_plot` (as can most `sspm` objects). 

```{r}
bounds <- spm_as_boundary(boundaries = sfa_boundaries, 
                          boundary_column = "sfa")

plot(bounds)
```

2. The second step consists in wrapping a `data.frame`, `tibble` or `sf` object into a `sspm_data` object, with a few other pieces of relevant information, such as the name, dataset type (biomass, predictor or catch, depending on the type of information contained), time column and coordinates column (i not `sf`) and unique row identifier. Here we wrap the borealis dataset that contains the biomass information.

```{r}
biomass_dataset <- 
  spm_as_dataset(borealis, name = "borealis", 
                 time_column = "year_f",
                 coords = c('lon_dec','lat_dec'), uniqueID = "uniqueID")

biomass_dataset
```

3. We do the same with the predator data, which are of the predictor type.

```{r}
predator_dataset <- 
  spm_as_dataset(predator, name = "all_predators", 
                 time_column = "year",
                 uniqueID = "uniqueID", coords = c("lon_dec", "lat_dec"))

predator_dataset
```

4. The `sspm` workflow relies on the discretization of the boundary objects, the default method being voronoi tesselation.

```{r}
bounds_voronoi <- bounds %>% 
  spm_discretize(method = "tesselate_voronoi",
                 with = biomass_dataset, 
                 nb_samples = 10)

bounds_voronoi
```

The other available method is `triangulate_delaunay` for delaunay triangulation. Here the `a` argument is used to set the size of the mesh (see `RTriangle::triangulate` for more details).

```{r}
bounds_delaunay <- bounds %>% 
  spm_discretize(method = "triangulate_delaunay", a = 1, q = 30)
```

5. Plotting the object shows the polygons that have been created.

```{r}
plot(bounds_voronoi)
```

```{r}
plot(bounds_delaunay)
```

6. The results of the discretization can also be explored with `spm_patches()` and `spm_points()`.

```{r}
spm_patches(bounds_voronoi)
spm_points(bounds_voronoi)
```

7. The next step in this workflow is to smooth the variables to be used in the final `sspm` model, by using spatial-temporal smoothers, by passing each dataset through `spm_smooth`. Here we first smooth `weight_per_km2` as well as `temp_at_bottom`. Note that the boundary column `sfa` can be used in the formula as the data will be first joined to the provided boundaries.

```{r}
biomass_smooth <- biomass_dataset %>%  
  spm_smooth(weight_per_km2 ~ sfa + smooth_time(by=sfa) + smooth_space() + 
               smooth_space_time(k = c(NA, 30)),
             boundaries = bounds_voronoi, drop.unused.levels = F, family=tw, 
             method= "fREML", keep_fit = T) %>% 
  spm_smooth(temp_at_bottom ~ smooth_time(by=sfa) + smooth_space() + 
               smooth_space_time(k = c(NA, 30)),
             drop.unused.levels = F, family=gaussian, method= "fREML", 
             keep_fit = T)

biomass_smooth
```

8. The smoothed results for any smoothed variables (listed in "smoothed vars" above) can be easily plotted:

```{r}
plot(biomass_smooth, var = "weight_per_km2", log = FALSE)
```
You can also make a spatial plot

```{r}
plot(biomass_smooth, var = "weight_per_km2", use_sf = TRUE)
```

9. We also smooth the `weight_per_km2` variable in the predator data.

```{r}
predator_smooth <- predator_dataset %>%  
  spm_smooth(weight_per_km2 ~ smooth_time(k = 3) + smooth_space(),
             boundaries = bounds_voronoi,
             drop.unused.levels = F, family=tw, method= "fREML")

predator_smooth
```

10. Before we assemble the full model with our newly smoothed data, we need to deal with the catch data. We first load the dataset.

```{r}
catch_dataset <- 
  spm_as_dataset(catch, name = "catch_data", 
                 time_column = "year_f", 
                 uniqueID = "uniqueID", coords = c("lon_start", "lat_start"))

catch_dataset
```

11. We then need to aggregate this data. This illustrate using the `spm_aggregate` functions. Here we use `spm_aggregate_catch`:

```{r}
biomass_smooth_w_catch <- 
  spm_aggregate_catch(biomass = biomass_smooth, 
                      catch = catch_dataset, 
                      biomass_variable = "weight_per_km2",
                      catch_variable = "catch",
                      fill = mean)

biomass_smooth_w_catch
```

12. Once data has been smoothed, we can assemble a `sspm` model object, using one dataset of type biomass, one dataset of type predictor and (optionnaly) a dataset of type catch.

```{r}
sspm_model <- sspm(biomass = biomass_smooth_w_catch, 
                   predictors = predator_smooth)

sspm_model
```

13. Before fitting the model, we must split data into test/train with `spm_split`.

```{r}
sspm_model <- sspm_model %>% 
  spm_split(year_f %in% c(1990:2017))

sspm_model
```

14. To fit the model, we might be interested in including lagged values. This is done with `spm_lag`.

```{r}
sspm_model <- sspm_model %>% 
  spm_lag(vars = c("weight_per_km2_borealis_with_catch", 
                   "weight_per_km2_all_predators"), 
          n = 1)

sspm_model
```

15. We can now fit the final spm model with `spm`. 

```{r}
sspm_model_fit <- sspm_model %>% 
  spm(log_productivity ~ sfa +
        weight_per_km2_all_predators_lag_1 +
        smooth_lag("weight_per_km2_borealis_with_catch") + 
        smooth_space(), 
      family = mgcv::scat)

sspm_model_fit
```

16. Plotting the object produces a actual vs predicted plot (with TEST/TRAIN data highlighted.

```{r}
plot(sspm_model_fit, train_test = TRUE, scales = "free")
```

17. We can also extract the predictions.
```{r}
preds <- predict(sspm_model_fit)
head(preds)
```
We can also get the predictions for biomass by passing the biomass variable name.
```{r}
biomass_preds <- predict(sspm_model_fit, biomass = "weight_per_km2_borealis")
head(biomass_preds)
```

We can also predict the biomass one step ahead.

```{r}
biomass_one_step <- predict(sspm_model_fit, biomass = "weight_per_km2_borealis", 
                            next_ts = TRUE)
head(biomass_one_step)
```

18. We can produce an array of plots, as timeseries or as spatial plots

```{r}
plot(sspm_model_fit)
plot(sspm_model_fit, use_sf = TRUE)
```

```{r}
plot(sspm_model_fit, biomass = "weight_per_km2_borealis")
plot(sspm_model_fit, biomass = "weight_per_km2_borealis", use_sf = TRUE)
```

```{r}
plot(sspm_model_fit, biomass = "weight_per_km2_borealis", next_ts = T, 
     biomass_data_origin = biomass_smooth, 
     biomass_var_origin = "weight_per_km2")
```
