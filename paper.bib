	abstract = {The potential inﬂuence of climate change on the future distribution and abundance of ﬁsh (and therefore commercial ﬁsheries and food security) is increasingly recognized in the ﬁshery management community. A changing climate will likely have differing effects on different species; some will ﬂourish, some will ﬂounder. Management targets for ﬁshing mortality and spawning biomass are often calculated by assuming stationary population processes, but under climate change, this assumption may be violated. Non-stationary population processes can introduce bias into estimates of biomass from stock assessments and calculations of target ﬁshing mortalities and biomasses. However, few accepted frameworks exist for incorporating the changing inﬂuence of the environment on exploited populations into management strategies. Identifying changes in population processes due to environmental inﬂuences is important in order to enable climate-enhanced management strategy evaluations to elucidate the potential beneﬁts and costs of changing management targets. Cost/beneﬁt analyses will also be useful when coincidentally caught species respond differently to environmental change.},

	abstract = {Identifying the existence and magnitude of density dependence is one of the oldest concerns in ecology. Ecologists have aimed to estimate density dependence in population and community data by ﬁtting a simple autoregressive (Gompertz) model for density dependence to time series of abundance for an entire population. However, it is increasingly recognized that spatial heterogeneity in population densities has implications for population and community dynamics. We therefore adapt the Gompertz model to approximate local densities over continuous space instead of population-wide abundance, and allow productivity to vary spatially using Gaussian random ﬁelds. We then show that the conventional (nonspatial) Gompertz model can result in biased estimates of density dependence (e.g., identifying oscillatory dynamics when not present) if densities vary spatially. By contrast, the spatial Gompertz model provides accurate and precise estimates of density dependence for a variety of simulation scenarios and data availabilities. These results are corroborated when comparing spatial and nonspatial models for data from 10 years and ;100 sampling stations for three long-lived rockﬁshes (Sebastes spp.) off the California, USA coast. In this case, the nonspatial model estimates implausible oscillatory dynamics on an annual time scale, while the spatial model estimates strong autocorrelation and is supported by model selection tools. We conclude by discussing the importance of improved data archiving techniques, so that spatial models can be used to reexamine classic questions regarding the existence and magnitude of density dependence in wild populations.},
